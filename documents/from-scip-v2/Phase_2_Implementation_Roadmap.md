## ðŸš¨ **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Multi-team synchronization**: Buffer time in Week 3 for integration issues
- **Real-time performance**: Early testing and optimization in Week 2
- **Docker complexity**: Simplified deployment scripts and documentation
- **Decision branching**: Comprehensive testing with multiple scenario paths

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to Phase 2 requirements only
- **Integration delays**: Daily integration testing and issue resolution
- **Performance issues**: Load testing throughout development, not just at end
- **Polish time**: Dedicated time in Week 3 for UI/UX improvements

### **Contingency Plans**
- **Feature prioritization**: Critical path items (Tasks 11-13) completed first
- **Simplified deployment**: Docker Compose fallback if orchestration complex
