# SCIP v2 Phase 1 Security Implementation

## Overview
This document details the critical security fixes implemented in Phase 1 of the SCIP v2 multi-tenant platform security hardening initiative.

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Secure Admin Credential Management
**Previous Issue:** Hardcoded admin credentials in configuration files
**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed all hardcoded admin credentials from `config.py`
- Admin credentials now **must** be provided via environment variables
- Added runtime validation to ensure admin credentials meet security requirements:
  - Minimum 12 characters for admin passwords
  - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Cannot contain common weak patterns
- Created `AdminInitializer` class for secure admin account initialization
- Added secure password generation utility for admin password rotation
- Passwords are immediately cleared from memory after use

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/app/core/config.py`
- `/backend/app/core/admin_init.py` (new)

### 2. JWT Token Revocation/Blacklisting
**Previous Issue:** No mechanism to revoke JWT tokens before expiration
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive `TokenBlacklistService` with Redis backend
- Automatic expiration of blacklisted tokens using Redis TTL
- Support for individual token revocation and bulk user token revocation
- Integration with JWT decoding to check blacklist before accepting tokens
- Statistics tracking for blacklisted tokens
- Health check functionality for the blacklist service

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/app/core/token_blacklist.py` (new)
- `/backend/app/core/security.py`
- `/backend/app/main.py`

### 3. PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
**Previous Issue:** Multi-tenant isolation only enforced at application level
**Solution Implemented:**
- Comprehensive RLS policies for all tenant-specific tables
- Organization-based data isolation at database level
- User-specific policies for sensitive data (API keys, sessions)
- Superuser bypass for system administration
- Performance-optimized indexes for RLS queries
- Helper functions for setting security context

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/alembic/versions/001_add_rls_policies.py` (new migration)

**RLS Coverage:**
- Users table: Organization isolation
- Scenarios table: Organization isolation with public sharing support
- Exercises table: Strict organization isolation
- Audit logs: Immutable, organization-scoped
- API keys: User-scoped with admin override
- Sessions: User-scoped with admin override

### 4. Docker Container Security Hardening
**Previous Issue:** Containers running as root with excessive privileges
**Solution Implemented:**
- Non-root user (UID 1001) for all application containers
- Security options: `no-new-privileges:true`
- Capability dropping: `cap_drop: ALL`
- Read-only filesystem with specific tmpfs mounts
- Removed unnecessary packages and build artifacts
- Proper file permissions (750) for application directories
- Health checks using Python instead of curl (reduces attack surface)

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/Dockerfile`
- `/docker-compose.yml`

### 5. TrustedHost Middleware Configuration
**Previous Issue:** Wildcard (*) allowed hosts in production
**Solution Implemented:**
- Dynamic configuration from `TRUSTED_HOSTS` environment variable
- Validation and warning for wildcard usage
- Default to restrictive host list if not properly configured
- Logging of configured hosts for audit purposes
- Support for domain patterns (e.g., `*.scip.local`)

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/app/main.py`
- `/backend/app/core/config.py`

### 6. Enhanced Security Utilities
**Additional security features implemented:**
- MFA/TOTP support with backup codes
- Enhanced password validation with history checking
- Suspicious login detection
- Input sanitization utilities
- Security headers management
- Rate limiting key generation

## Environment Variables Required

### Critical Security Variables (Required in Production)
```bash
# Admin Credentials (no defaults in production)
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password_min_12_chars
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com

# Database Password (required)
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

# Redis Password (required)
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# JWT Secret Keys (minimum 32 characters)
SECRET_KEY=your-very-long-secret-key-for-encryption-min-32-chars
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-for-token-signing-min-32-chars

# Trusted Hosts (comma-separated)
TRUSTED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,api.yourdomain.com,*.yourdomain.com
```

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and set all required security variables
# NEVER commit .env to version control
```

### 2. Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Run the RLS migration
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Initialize Admin Account
The admin account will be automatically created on first startup if:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set in environment
- No existing admin user exists

### 4. Deploy with Docker Compose
```bash
# Use production configuration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# For development (less restrictive)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Security Testing

Run the comprehensive security test suite:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/test_security_phase1.py -v
```

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables set with strong values
- [ ] No default or example passwords in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Redis connection configured with password
- [ ] TRUSTED_HOSTS configured with specific domains

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Admin account created successfully
- [ ] Token blacklisting service operational
- [ ] RLS policies active (verify with database queries)
- [ ] Containers running as non-root user
- [ ] Security headers present in API responses

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Token Blacklist Monitoring
```python
# Check blacklist statistics
GET /api/v1/admin/security/blacklist/stats
```

### RLS Verification
```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Container Security Audit
```bash
# Check container is running as non-root
docker exec scip-backend whoami  # Should return 'app'

# Verify read-only filesystem
docker exec scip-backend touch /test.txt  # Should fail
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Password Rotation**: Rotate admin password every 90 days
2. **Token Management**: Implement token refresh strategy
3. **Audit Logging**: Monitor all admin actions
4. **Database Backups**: Encrypted backups with RLS context
5. **Security Updates**: Regular updates of base images and dependencies

## Known Limitations

1. **Token Blacklist Cache**: Requires Redis to be operational
2. **RLS Performance**: May impact query performance on large datasets
3. **Container Restrictions**: Some debugging tools unavailable due to security

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

- [ ] Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- [ ] Advanced threat detection
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Compliance reporting (SOC2, ISO27001)
- [ ] Zero-trust network architecture
