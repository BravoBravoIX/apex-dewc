## 🏗️ Key Architecture Decisions

### Asset Reuse Strategy
- **MQTT Infrastructure**: Adapt from `reference/scip-range/.../backend/network_metrics_collector.py`
- **Topic Structure**: Based on `reference/scip-range/.../mqtt/topic_structure.txt`
- **React Components**: Adapt from `reference/scip-range/.../frontend/src/components/pages/ScenarioOperations/`
- **Instance Management**: Enhance `reference/scip-range/.../backend/instances_simulator.py`

### Topic Hierarchy Design
```
exercise/{exercise_id}/
├── instructor/
│   ├── control          # Emergency controls, turn advancement
│   ├── status           # Exercise-wide status updates
│   └── analytics        # Real-time metrics
├── team/{team_id}/
│   ├── content/{type}   # Content delivery by type
│   ├── decisions        # Team decision submissions
│   ├── status          # Team health and progress
│   └── alerts          # Team-specific alerts
└── events/             # Exercise-wide event stream
```

### Component Integration Points
- **ScenarioService** → **ExerciseContentDelivery** (content scheduling)
- **DeploymentService** → **ExerciseTurnManager** (team coordination)
- **MQTT Service** → **ExerciseWebSocketGateway** (real-time bridge)
- **Redis State** → **ExerciseStateManager** (persistence)
