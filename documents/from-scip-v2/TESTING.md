## Best Practices

### Test Organization
1. **Clear naming conventions**: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`
2. **Descriptive docstrings**: Explain test purpose and expectations
3. **Minimal test data**: Use factories for consistent test data
4. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and repeatable

### Security Testing
1. **Defense in depth**: Test multiple security layers
2. **Real-world scenarios**: Simulate actual attack patterns
3. **Boundary testing**: Test edge cases and limits
4. **Continuous monitoring**: Regular security test execution

### Coverage Strategy
1. **Critical path focus**: Ensure high coverage for security-critical code
2. **Edge case testing**: Cover error conditions and edge cases
3. **Integration coverage**: Test component interactions
4. **Regression prevention**: Add tests for discovered bugs

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Tasks
- Update security test patterns based on new threats
- Review and update coverage requirements
- Validate performance baselines
