- `Dockerfile` - Python 3.11 slim container

### 4. MQTT Broker Configuration ✅
**Location:** `/Users/brettburford/Development/CyberOps/scip-v2/mosquitto`

- Eclipse Mosquitto 2.0 broker
- WebSocket support on port 9001
- MQTT protocol on port 1883
- Configured for 10MB message size (media support)
- Persistence enabled

### 5. Docker Compose Infrastructure ✅
**Location:** `/Users/brettburford/Development/CyberOps/scip-v2/docker-compose.yml`

- Three-service architecture
- Custom bridge network (172.20.0.0/16)
- Volume mounts for scenarios, uploads, thumbnails
- Health checks for all services
- Service dependencies properly configured

## Current System Status

### Running Services:
| Service | Container | Port | Status | Health |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| SCIP Client | scip-client | 3001 | Running | Healthy |
| Orchestration | orchestration | 8001 | Running | Healthy |
| MQTT Broker | mqtt | 1883, 9001 | Running | Healthy |

### API Endpoints Available:
- **Web Interface:** http://localhost:3001
- **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8001/docs
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8001/health
- **API Info:** http://localhost:8001/api/v1/info

### System Capabilities:
```json
{
  "scenarios": true,
  "teams": true,
  "media": true,
  "exercise_control": true,
  "mqtt_messaging": true,
  "container_management": false  // Docker-in-Docker setup needed
}
```

```

## Key Technical Decisions:

1. **React with TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
2. **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
3. **FastAPI** for high-performance async Python backend
4. **Eclipse Mosquitto** for reliable MQTT messaging
5. **JSON file storage** for simplicity in Phase 1 (database can be added later)
6. **Docker Compose** for local development and easy deployment
7. **Nginx** for production-ready static file serving

## Testing Results:

- ✅ All containers build successfully
- ✅ All services start and pass health checks
- ✅ Web interface accessible at http://localhost:3001
- ✅ API responds at http://localhost:8001
- ✅ MQTT broker accepts connections
- ✅ Volume mounts working correctly

## Known Limitations:

1. **Docker-in-Docker:** Container management from orchestration service requires additional configuration
2. **Authentication:** No authentication system implemented yet
3. **Data Persistence:** Using file system, not a database
4. **Media Processing:** Thumbnail generation not yet implemented

## Next Steps (Phase 2):

1. Implement JSON storage service functionality
2. Create scenario CRUD operations
3. Build team management system
4. Develop media upload capabilities
5. Create injection timeline system

## Commands for Management:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose build

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Access shell in container
docker exec -it [container-name] sh
```

## Deliverables Completed:

- [x] Clean development environment
- [x] Working SCIP client container with React UI
- [x] Basic orchestration service with FastAPI
- [x] MQTT broker configured and running
- [x] Docker Compose setup with all services
- [x] Volume mounts for data persistence
- [x] Health checks and monitoring
- [x] Basic API structure and routing

## Phase 1 Summary:

Phase 1 has been successfully completed with all core infrastructure components in place. The system provides a solid foundation for building the SCIP v2 platform with:

- Modern, scalable architecture
- Professional UI framework
- Real-time messaging capability
- RESTful API structure
- Container-based deployment

The foundation is ready for Phase 2 implementation, which will focus on data models, storage, and core functionality.
