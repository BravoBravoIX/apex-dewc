# Audio Files

Place alert audio file here:

- `alert.mp3` - Alert sound for critical notifications

If no audio file is present, the dashboards will continue to function but without audio alerts. The browser console will show a warning that the audio file could not be loaded.

You can use any short alert sound (1-2 seconds recommended) in MP3 format.
